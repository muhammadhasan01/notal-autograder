# NotasiAlgoritmik-AST-and-CFG-Generator

## About
This repository contains the source code for my undergraduate thesis.

## Abstract
> Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Control Flow Graph (CFG) are representation of a program code that is quite widely used for static analysis. One of the developments of static analysis is the development of an automated grader for the evaluation of programming learning. 
> Notasi Algoritmik is a notation used in the Informatics Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology for the benefit of programming learning, including those related to the evaluation of programming learning. 
> Until this paper was made, there is no research about how AST and CFG are constructed from Notasi Algoritmik even though it can be used to develop an automated grader to solve the assessment problem in the evaluation of programming learning which is still done manually. Therefore, in this paper, a research was conducted to construct the AST and CFG from Notasi Algoritmik, so the development of an automated grader for programming assignment that uses Notasi Algoritmik can be conducted in the future.
